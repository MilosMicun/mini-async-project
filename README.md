# Mini Async JS Project

## Description
A simple JavaScript mini-project demonstrating asynchronous programming using async/await.  
The project simulates a small product flow:

1. Fetch a list of products
2. Check stock for each product
3. Apply a discount if applicable

All functions are asynchronous and include error handling.

## How to Run
1. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd mini-async-project
Run the project:
node index.js

Expected Output

The program outputs a table listing all products, their stock, original price, discounted price (if applied), and errors if any.
